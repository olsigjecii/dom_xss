# DOM XSS: A Rust Perspective

Document Object Model (DOM)-based Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a web vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into a user's browser.  Unlike traditional XSS where the vulnerability lies in how the server handles data, DOM XSS happens entirely on the client-side.  The vulnerability arises when a web application's client-side scripts unsafely handle user-controllable data, which then gets executed in the browser. 



While the actual execution of the malicious script happens in the browser's JavaScript environment, a backend written in Rust can still be the source of the vulnerable data or fail to implement the necessary protections.

A Quick Refresher on the DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.  The DOM allows web pages to be dynamic and interactive without needing to reload from the server for every change.  It organizes a web page into a tree of objects, where each object can be manipulated.

Of course! As a security engineer and Rust expert, I'd be happy to translate the lesson on DOM XSS to Rust for you. We'll explore how DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting can occur in applications with a Rust backend and how to prevent it using Rust's security-conscious principles.

DOM XSS in a Rust Application
Let's imagine a scenario. A developer named Zane is working for a new social media company, "Friendy.io."  He has just shipped a new feature allowing users to customize their profile's color scheme.  The user's chosen color is passed as a URL query parameter and applied by client-side JavaScript.


Our task is to perform a security audit on this new feature to check for DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
